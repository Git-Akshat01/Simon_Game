A game for sharpening of Brain.
🎮🕹️ Welcome to the Simon Game! 🕹️🎮

This is a fun memory game that requires you to remember a sequence of flashing lights and sounds. The game has four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. Each button produces a unique sound when pressed.

🔴🔵🟢🟡 To play the game: 🔴🔵🟢🟡

Go with this link: https://git-akshat01.github.io/Simon_Game/

Then press the "Start" button to begin. Simon will play a sequence of flashing lights and sounds. Remember the sequence! After the sequence ends, repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. If you get the sequence correct, Simon will add another step to the sequence. If you get the sequence wrong, the game will end. 💡 Tips: 💡

Start with a small sequence (e.g. two or three steps) and work your way up as you get better. Pay attention to both the color and the sound of each button. Try to come up with a mnemonic device (e.g. a phrase or song) to help you remember the sequence. 🏆 Good luck and have fun! 🏆
